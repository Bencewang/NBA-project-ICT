<h1> <u>The GOAT in every category</u></h1>
<p> The GOAT: The GOAT conversation in Basketball is extremely difficult to say, however, it is commonly accepted that Michael Jordan is the GOAT. Michael Jordan won 6 championships and won all 6 of the finals MVPs (Most Valuable Player), he won 5 regular season MVPs and won a DPOY ( Defensive Player of the Year). For most of his Career, Michael Jordan played for the Chicago Bulls as a shooting guard, but he came out of retirement in 2001 and played 2 more years for the Washington Wizardz.
But we cannot mention Michael Jordan as the GOAT without bringing up LeBron James who currently plays for the Los Angeles Lakers but had stints in the Heat and the Cavaliers. </p>
